Simple Node Chat Room
=====================

This is a basic chat room built with Node.js and WebSockets. It was my first Node project, and first javascript project in general. I followed [this tutorial](http://martinsikora.com/nodejs-and-websocket-simple-chat-tutorial) for the most part. After I added an active members (people currently in the chat room) for a little extra practice.

Running the App
---------------
Assuming you already have [node](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/) installed...

Install the dependencies:

    npm install

Start the server:

    node chat-server.js

Visit chatroom.html from two different pages, and start talking to yourself.
