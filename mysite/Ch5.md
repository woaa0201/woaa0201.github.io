# 5.1 Logarithms and their Properties
## Objectives
* I can convert between exponential and logarithmic statements.
* I can apply the properties of logarithms to solve equations.

# Common Logarithm Function
* If $x$ is a positive number, $\log(x)$ is the exponent of 10 that gives $x$.
* In other words, if $y = \log(x)$ then $10^y = x$.

# Example 1
Rewrite the following statements using exponents instead of logs.

* $\log(4) = 0.602$
* $\log(q) = z$

# Example 2
Evaluate with a calculator.

* $\log(10^7)$
* $10^{\log(5)}$

# Properties of the Common Logarithm
* By definition, $y = \log(x)$ means $10^y = x$. In particular, $\log(1) = 0$ and $\log(10) = 1$.
* The functions $10^x$ and $\log(x)$ are inverses, so they "undo" each other: $\log(10^x) = x$ for all $x$ and $10^{\log(x)} = x$ for $x > 0$.
* For $a$ and $b$ both positive and any value of $t$: $\log(ab) = \log(a) + \log(b)$, $\log\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) = \log(a) - \log(b)$, and $\log(b^t) = t\log(b)$.

# Example 3
Solve the equation using logs.
$$(1.45)^x = 25$$

# The Natural Logarithm
* For $x > 0$, $\ln(x)$ is the power of $e$ that gives $x$. 
* In symbols, $\ln(x) = y$ means $e^y = x$, and $y$ is called the **natural logarithm** of $x$.

# Properties of the Natural Logarithm
* By definition, $y = \ln(x)$ means $x = e^y$. In particular, $\ln 1 = 0$ and $\ln e = 1$.
* The functions $e^x$ and $\ln x$ are inverses, so they "undo" each other: $\ln(e^x) = x$ for all $x$ and $e^{\ln x} = x$ for $x > 0$.
* For $a$ and $b$ both positive and any value of $t$: $\ln (ab) = \ln a + \ln b$, $\ln \left(\frac{a}{b}\right) = \ln a - \ln b$, and $\ln (b^t) = t\ln b$.

# Example 4
Solve the equation using logs.
$$10 = 22(0.87)^q$$

*Properties of the Natural Logarithm*

* The functions $e^x$ and $\ln x$ are inverses, so they "undo" each other: $\ln(e^x) = x$ for all $x$ and $e^{\ln x} = x$ for $x > 0$.
* For $a$ and $b$ both positive and any value of $t$: $\ln (ab) = \ln a + \ln b$, $\ln \left(\frac{a}{b}\right) = \ln a - \ln b$, and $\ln (b^t) = t\ln b$.

# Misconceptions Involving Logs Notes
* $\log(a+b) \neq \log(a) + \log(b)$
* $\log(a-b) \neq \log(a) - \log(b)$
* $\log(ab) \neq (\log(a))(\log(b))$
* $\log\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) \neq \frac{\log(a)}{\log(b)}$
* $\log\left(\frac{1}{a}\right) \neq \frac{1}{\log(a)}$
