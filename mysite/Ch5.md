# 5.1 Logarithms and their Properties
## Objectives
* I can convert between exponential and logarithmic statements.
* I can apply the properties of logarithms to solve equations.

# Common Logarithm Function
* If $x$ is a positive number, $\log(x)$ is the exponent of 10 that gives $x$.
* In other words, if $y = \log(x)$ then $10^y = x$.

# Example 1
Rewrite the following statements using exponents instead of logs.

* $\log(4) = 0.602$
* $\log(q) = z$

# Example 2
Evaluate with a calculator.

* $\log(10^7)$
* $10^{\log(5)}$

# Properties of the Common Logarithm
* By definition, $y = \log(x)$ means $10^y = x$. In particular, $\log(1) = 0$ and $\log(10) = 1$.
* The functions $10^x$ and $\log(x)$ are inverses, so they "undo" each other: $\log(10^x) = x$ for all $x$ and $10^{\log(x)} = x$ for $x > 0$.
* For $a$ and $b$ both positive and any value of $t$: $\log(ab) = \log(a) + \log(b)$, $\log\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) = \log(a) - \log(b)$, and $\log(b^t) = t\log(b)$.

# Example 3
Solve the equation using logs.
$$(1.45)^x = 25$$

# The Natural Logarithm
* For $x > 0$, $\ln(x)$ is the power of $e$ that gives $x$. 
* In symbols, $\ln(x) = y$ means $e^y = x$, and $y$ is called the **natural logarithm** of $x$.

# Properties of the Natural Logarithm
* By definition, $y = \ln(x)$ means $x = e^y$. In particular, $\ln 1 = 0$ and $\ln e = 1$.
* The functions $e^x$ and $\ln x$ are inverses, so they "undo" each other: $\ln(e^x) = x$ for all $x$ and $e^{\ln x} = x$ for $x > 0$.
* For $a$ and $b$ both positive and any value of $t$: $\ln (ab) = \ln a + \ln b$, $\ln \left(\frac{a}{b}\right) = \ln a - \ln b$, and $\ln (b^t) = t\ln b$.

# Example 4
Solve the equation using logs.
$$10 = 22(0.87)^q$$

# Warm-Up Problem
1. Use the properties of logarithms to solve for $x$.
$$\log(3(2)^x) = 8$$

2. Solve the equation exactly for $x$.
$$e^{x+5} = 7(2)^x$$

*Properties of the Natural Logarithm*

* The functions $e^x$ and $\ln x$ are inverses, so they "undo" each other: $\ln(e^x) = x$ for all $x$ and $e^{\ln x} = x$ for $x > 0$.
* For $a$ and $b$ both positive and any value of $t$: $\ln (ab) = \ln a + \ln b$, $\ln \left(\frac{a}{b}\right) = \ln a - \ln b$, and $\ln (b^t) = t\ln b$.

# Warm-Up Problem 1 Solution
1. Use the properties of logarithms to solve for $x$.

\begin{align*}
\log(3(2)^x) &= 8 \\
\log(3)+\log(2^x) &= 8 \\
\log(3)+x\log(2) &= 8 \\
x\log(2) &= 8-\log(3) \\
x &= \frac{8-\log(3)}{\log(2)} \\
\end{align*}

# Warm-Up Problem 2 Solution
2. Solve the equation exactly for $x$.

\begin{align*}
e^{x+5} &= 7(2)^x \\
\ln(e^{x+5}) &= \ln(7(2)^x) \\
x+5 &= \ln(7)+\ln((2)^x) \\
x+5 &= \ln(7)+x\ln(2) \\
x-x\ln(2) &= \ln(7)-5 \\
x(1-\ln(2)) &= \ln(7)-5 \\
x &= \frac{\ln(7)-5}{1-\ln(2)}
\end{align*}

# 5.2 Logarithms and Exponential Models
## Objectives
* I can use logarithms to solve exponential equations.
* I can setup an exponential equation to model doubling and half-life.

# Example 1 - Doubling Time
You place 1000 MMK in a KBZ Bank fixed deposit bank account. According to their website, a 1 month term account earns 9% interest, 3 months earns 9.25%, 6 months earns 9.5%, 9 months earns 9.75%, and 12 months earns 10%.

* How often is a fixed account compounded at KBZ Bank?
* $\$ 1 \approx 1300$ MMK. If you deposit \$1000000 into the KBZ fixed deposit account with a 12 month term, how much interest would you earn?
* If you open an account with 1000 MMK, how long would it take to double your money with each term account?

# Example 1 - Doubling Time - Solution
You place 1000 MMK in a KBZ Bank fixed deposit bank account. According to their website, a 1 month term account earns 9% interest, 3 months earns 9.25%, 6 months earns 9.5%, 9 months earns 9.75%, and 12 months earns 10%.

* How often is a fixed account compounded at KBZ Bank? Depends on the term. $B = P\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}$
* $\$ 1 \approx 1300$ MMK. If you deposit \$1,000,000 into the KBZ fixed deposit account with a 12 month term, how much interest would you earn? $P = 1000000$, $t = 1$, $r = 0.1$, $n = 1$, so $B = 1000000\left(1+\frac{0.1}{1}\right)^{1(1)} = 1100000$. This means they earn $100000 in interest.
* If you open an account with 1000 MMK, how long would it take to double your money with each term account?
* 1 month: $n = 12$ and $r = 0.09$, so $2000 = 1000\left(1+\frac{0.09}{12}\right)^{12t}$. $t = \ln(2)/(12\ln\left(1+\frac{0.09}{12}\right)) \approx 7.730$ years.
* 3 months: $n = 4$ and $r = 0.0925$, so $2000 = 1000\left(1+\frac{0.0925}{4}\right)^{4t}$. $t = \ln(2)/(4\ln\left(1+\frac{0.0925}{4}\right)) \approx 7.579$ years.
* 6 months: $n = 2$ and $r = 0.095$, so $2000 = 1000\left(1+\frac{0.095}{2}\right)^{2t}$. $t = \ln(2)/(2\ln\left(1+\frac{0.095}{2}\right)) \approx 7.468$ years.
* 9 months: $n = 12/9$ and $r = 0.0975$, so $2000 = 1000\left(1+\frac{0.0975}{12/9}\right)^{(12/9)t}$. $t = \ln(2)/((12/9)\ln\left(1+\frac{0.0975}{(12/9)}\right)) \approx 7.366$ years.
* 12 months: $n = 1$ and $r = 0.1$, so $2000 = 1000\left(1+\frac{0.1}{1}\right)^{(1)t}$. $t = \ln(2)/(1\ln\left(1+\frac{0.1}{1}\right)) \approx 7.272$ years.

# Example 2 - Half-Life

The Chernobyl expolosion in 1986 initially had a radiation reading of 300 Sv/hr near the reactor core. After 22 years, the radiation levels inside the reactor hall were about 34 Sv/hr. More than half of people exponsed to 5 Sv will die from the radiation.

<center>

</center>

* What is the rate at which the radiation is decaying? Assume exponential decay.
* How long was it until half the radiation remained?
* How long would it take to receive a lethal dose of radiation in the reactor hall today?

# Example 2 - Half-Life - Solution

The Chernobyl expolosion in 1986 initially had a radiation reading of 300 Sv/hr near the reactor core. After 22 years, the radiation levels inside the reactor hall were about 34 Sv/hr. More than half of people exponsed to 5 Sv will die from the radiation.

* What is the rate at which the radiation is decaying? Assume exponential decay. $34 = 300e^{k(22)}$, so $k = \ln(34/300)/22 \approx -0.098973725$, so down by 9.897%.
* How long was it until half the radiation remained? $150 = 300e^{-0.098973725t}$, so $t = \ln(150/300)/(-0.098973725) \approx 7.003345388$ years.
* How long would it take to receive a lethal dose of radiation in the reactor hall today? $Sv = 300e^{-0.098973725(30)} \approx 15.40312983$, so 15 Sv/hr would mean 5 Sv in 20 minutes.

# Converting Between $Q = ab^t$ and $Q = ae^t$
Any exponential function can be written in either of the two forms:
$$Q = ab^t \text{ or } Q = ae^{kt}$$
If $b = e^k$, so $k = \ln(b)$, the two formulas represent the same function.

# Example 3
Convert to the form $Q = ab^t$.
$$Q = 0.3e^{0.7t}$$

# Example 4
Convert to the form $Q = ae^{kt}$. Give the starting value $a$, the growth rate $r$, and the continuous growth rate $k$.
$$Q = 5(2)^{t/8}$$
