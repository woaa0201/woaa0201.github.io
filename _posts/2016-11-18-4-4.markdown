# Previous Homework Questions

Any questions on Page 152 \#23-45 odd?

# Warm Up Problem

- Is there a difference between a bank account that pays 24\% interest once per year and one that pays 2\% every month?
- Which would you rather have?

# Objectives

- I can setup an exponential function to model and answer questions about compound interest.
- I understand the difference between nominal rate and effective rate for earning interest.
\end{enumerate}

# Nominal Versus Effective Rate

The **nominal rate** is the interest rate over the year. It could be compounded monthly, daily, continuously, etc.

The **effective rate** tells you how much interest the investment actually earns after being compounded throughout the year.

\end{frame}

# Compound Interest Formula

If interest at an annual rate of $r$ is compounded $n$ times a year, then $r/n$ times the current balance is added $n$ times a year.  Therefore, with an initial deposit of \$$P$, the balance $t$ years later is

$$B = P \cdot \bigg(1+\cfrac{r}{n}\bigg)^{nt}$$

Note that $r$ is the nominal rate; for example, $r = 0.05$ if the annual rate is 5\%.

# Example 1

What are the nominal and effective annual rates of an account paying 24\% interest compounded monthly?

# Example 1 Solution

Nominal Rate: 24\%

Effective Rate: $\left(1+\frac{.24}{12}\right)^{12(1)} = (1.02)^{12} \approx 1.26824$, so 26.824\%

# Example 1 - You Try

What are the nominal and effective annual rates of an account paying 12\% interest, compounded semi-annually?  Compounded semi-monthly?

# Example 1 - You Try Solution
*Compounded semi-annually*

Nominal Rate: 12\%

Effective Rate: $\left(1+\frac{.12}{2}\right)^{2(1)} = (1.06)^{2} \approx 1.1236$, so 12.36\%

*Compounded semi-monthly*

Nominal Rate: 12\%

Effective Rate: $\left(1+\frac{.12}{24}\right)^{24(1)} = (1.005)^{24} \approx 1.12716$, so 12.716\%

# Example 2

What is the effective annual rate of an account that pays interest at the nominal rate of 6\% per year, compounded quarterly?  Compounded bi-monthly?

# Example 2 Solution

Compounded quarterly:

$\left(1+\frac{.06}{4}\right)^{4(1)} = (1.015)^{4} \approx 1.06136$, so 6.136\%

Compounded bi-monthly:

$\left(1+\frac{.06}{6}\right)^{6(1)} = (1.01)^{6} \approx 1.06152$, so 6.152\%

# Example 2 - You Try

What is the effective annual rate of an account that pays interest at the nominal rate of 10\% per year, compounded daily?  Compounded hourly?

# Example 2 - You Try Solution

Compounded quarterly:

$\left(1+\frac{.1}{365}\right)^{365(1)} = (1.000273973)^{365} \approx 1.105156$, so 10.5156\%

Compounded bi-monthly:

$\left(1+\frac{.1}{8760}\right)^{8760(1)} = (1.000011416)^{8760} \approx 1.10517$, so 10.517\%

\end{frame}

# Example 3

At the beginning of the year you deposit $P$ dollars in an account paying interest at the nominal rate of 4\% per year compounded quarterly.  By what factor does $P$ grow in 3 years?

# Example 3 Solution

$P\left(1+\frac{.04}{4}\right)^{4(3)} = P(1.01)^{12} \approx P\cdot 1.12682503$, or 12.682503\% increase.
