#Header 1

This is a sentence with inline math: $x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0$. This ends the 
paragraph for now.

This is centered math:

$$\int_a^b \! f(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = F(b) - F(a)$$

##Header 2

Inline math:

$$
\begin{align*}
x^2 + 2x + 1 &= 0 \\
(x + 1)^2 &= 0 \\
x + 1 &= 0 \\
x &= -1 \\
\end{align*}
$$
